clarity, and ease of use. It is also a compiler, taking source scriba
documents and rendering them to multi-page HTML, EPUB, and TeX. The
format includes flexible markup constructs designed to represent a
range of historical scientific material, but these can be used equally
well for new publications.</p><section><h2>An introduction to the language</h2><div class="sectionContent"><section><h3>Paragraphs</h3><div class="sectionContent"><p>The bulk of your document will most likely be paragraphs, sequences of
normal text and marked-up content representing a single idea in your
writing. A paragraph in scriba is a type of <em>block</em>, and contains
<em>paragraph text</em> and <em>elements</em>. Two sample paragraphs are
given below:</p><pre><code>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think
it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
{q|Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!} (when she thought it over
afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at
this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the
Rabbit actually {emph|took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket},
and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet,
for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a
rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of
it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it,
and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering
how in the world she was to get out again.</code></pre><p>Plain paragraph text is any span of unicode characters other than
<code>\</code>, <code>{</code>, or <code>}</code>, with the additional restriction
that paragraph text cannot contain blank lines; like in the example
above, these signal the end of the paragraph. Those three characters
can be represented in paragraph text using the sequences <code>\\</code>,
<code>\{</code>, and <code>\}</code>, should you need them in text. </p><p>The other feature of paragraph markup is <em>inline elements</em>, which
are used to give further meaning to your text and to control scriba&#39;s
many features. Simple
elements start with <code>{tag|</code> and end with <code>}</code>. The
paragraphs above have a <code>q</code> element, representing quoted text
and likely to be rendered between quotation marks, and an <code>emph</code>
element, representing emphasized text and likely to be rendered in
italic type.</p></div></section><section><h3>Sections</h3><div class="sectionContent"><p>The content of your document can be organized into <em>sections</em>,
representing self-contained units of discussion. These have types,
titles, and a body of blocks and subsections. Sections look like this:</p><pre><code># {title|An introduction to the language}

## {title|Paragraphs}

The bulk of your document â€¦</code></pre><p>The first component of a section is its <em>header</em>. The section
header starts with <code># sectionType</code>, the number of consecutive
<code>#</code> becoming the overall <em>level</em> of the section. The
section content begins after the attributes of the section and at
least one blank line, and continues until a section of at most that
level, or the end of the document, is reached. In the example above,
the <q>Paragraphs</q> section would continue until a level 2 or level 1
section were encountered. The section type is optional; section types
classify the section, can denote built-in document structure, and can
influence processing and rendering behaviour. Sections without a type
become a generic <code>section</code>.</p><p>Sections, like other elements, can have <em>attributes</em>. The only
recognized attribute of a section, for now, is its title. In future,
sections will have many attributes, like number, language, alternate
titles for the table of contents or page header, and so on. The
attributes of sections can be listed on multiple consecutive lines, as
long as no blank line occurs between them.</p></div></section><section><h3>Blocks</h3><div class="sectionContent"><p>The other type of syntactic form in scriba is the <em>block</em>
element. Blocks group their content and give it extra meaning, and can
appear wherever paragraphs or section headers can. Some blocks are
shown in the following code sample:</p><pre><code>&amp;{codeBlock {language|scriba} `
  An {emph|interesting} proposition.
`}

&amp;{olist&amp;
&amp;{li|First item}
&amp;{li|Second item}
}</code></pre><p>Blocks are written like inline elements, complete with attributes and
arguments, except they are preceded by a <code>&amp;</code>. They differ from
inline elements in their content: blocks have <em>verbatim</em>,
<em>block</em>, and <em>inline</em>. Verbatim content is signalled by a
<code>`</code> (backtick) character, starts on the next line, then runs
until the sequence <code>`}</code> appears at the start of a line. The
content itself becomes plain text; no control characters are
recognized in it. Block content is signalled by a <code>&amp;</code> character,
and consists of a sequence of blocks and paragraphs, like section
content without section headers. Finally, inline content is signalled
by a <code>|</code> and can contain text and inline elements.</p></div></section><section><h3>Mathematics</h3><div class="sectionContent"><p>Formal mathematical content can be included in a document with
particular inline elements. Inline formulas like <span class="math inline">\(2^3 = 8\)</span>, and
displayed formulas like
<span class="math display">\[
  \mathbf{B}(P) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}
  \int\frac{\mathbf{I}\times\hat{r}&#39;}{r&#39;^2}dl = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\,I\!
  \int\frac{d\boldsymbol{l}\times\hat{r}&#39;}{r&#39;^2}
\]</span>
are available, among other more complex constructs. Math rendering in
HTML is handled with MathJax.</p></div></section><section><h3>The overall document structure</h3><div class="sectionContent"></div></section></div></section></div></section><section class="backMatter"><div class="sectionContent"></div></section></section></body></html>
