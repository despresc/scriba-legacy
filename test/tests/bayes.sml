&{problem|
{physPage|376} {emph|Given} the number of times in which an unknown event has
happened and failed: {emph|Required} the chance that the probability of its happening
in a single trial lies somewhere between any two degrees of probability that can
be named.

&{definition&
&{olist&
&{li|Several events are {emph|inconsistent}, when if one of them happens, none of the
rest can.}

&{li|Two events are {emph|contrary} when one, or other of them must; and both together
cannot happen.}

&{li|An event is said to {emph|fail}, when it cannot happen; or, which comes to the same
thing, when its contrary has happened.}

&{li|An event is said to be determined when it has either happened or failed.}

&{li|The {emph|probability of any event} is the ratio between the value at which an
expectation depending on the happening of the event ought to be computed, and
the value of the thing expected upon {reg{old|it's}{new|its}} happening.}

&{li|By {emph|chance} I mean the same as probability.}

&{li|Events are independent when the happening of any one of them does neither
increase nor abate the probability of the rest.}
