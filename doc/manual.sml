# {title|Introduction}

Scriba is a markup language emphasizing extensibility, clarity, and
ease of use. It is also a compiler, taking source scriba documents and
rendering them to multi-page HTML, EPUB, and TeX. The format includes
flexible markup constructs designed to represent a range of historical
scientific material, but is equally useful for new publications.
