the school curriculum in mathematics that has taken place during the
last twenty years. Even I can remember the days when <q>Conics</q> and
<q>Mechanics</q> were the privilege of a select few, and only a prodigy
was initiated into the mysteries of the Differential (much less the
Integral) Calculus. All this is changed now, and it is fairly safe (at
least that is my experience) to assume that a boy who has won a
scholarship has learnt something about the Integral Calculus at
school.</p><p>I do not believe for a moment that the curriculum has been made
<em>harder</em>. These happy results are not due to any striking
development in the schoolboy himself, either in intelligence, or in
capacity or willingness for work. They are merely the result of
improvement in the methods of teaching and a wider range of knowledge
in the teacher, which enables him to discriminate, in a way his
predecessor could not, between what is really difficult and what is
not. No one now supposes that it is easy to resolve <span class="math inline">\(\sin x\)</span>
into factors and hard to differentiate it!—and even in my time it was
the former of these two problems to which one was set first.</p><p>Still there are difficulties, even in the Integral Calculus; it is not
every schoolboy who can do right everything that Todhunter and
Williamson did wrong; and when I find my pupils handling definite
integrals with the assurance of Dr. Hobson or Mr. Bromwich, I must
confess I sometimes wonder whether even the school curriculum cannot
be made too wide. Seriously, I do not think that schoolboys ought to
be taught anything about definite integrals. They really are
difficult, almost as difficult as the factors of <span class="math inline">\(\sin x\)</span>: and
it is to illustrate this point that I have written this note.</p><p>I have taken the particular integral
<span class="math display">\[
  \int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x} x dx
\tag{1}\label{subject}\]</span>
as my text for two reasons. One is that it is about as simple an
example as one can find of the definite integral <em>proper</em>—that is
to say the integral whose value can be expressed in finite terms,
although the indefinite integral of the subject of integration cannot
be so determined. The other is that two interesting notes by Mr. Berry
and Prof. Nanson have been published recently,<a class="noteMark" id="noteMark-berryNanson" href="#noteText-berryNanson">1</a>
in which they discuss a considerable number of different ways of
evaluating this particular integral. I propose now to apply a system
of <em>marking</em> to the different proofs of the equation
(<a class="ref" href="#mjx-eqn-subject"><span class="number">1</span></a>) to which they allude, with a view to rendering our
estimate of their relative difficulty more precise.</p><p>Practically all methods of evaluating any definite integral depend
ultimately upon the inversion of two or more operations of procedure
to a limit<a class="noteMark" id="noteMark-whetherThis" href="#noteText-whetherThis">2</a>—<span class="foreign">e.g.</span> upon the integration
of an infinite series or a differentiation under the integral sign:
that is to say they involve <q>double-limit
problems.</q><a class="noteMark" id="noteMark-forAnExplanation" href="#noteText-forAnExplanation">3</a> The only exceptions to this
statement of which I am aware (apart, of course, from cases in which
the indefinite integral can be found) are certain cases in which the
integral can be calculated directly from its definition as a sum, as
can the integrals
<span class="math display">\[
  \int_0^{-\frac 12 \pi} \log\sin\theta d\theta,\:
  \int_0^\pi \log{1 - 2p\cos\theta + p^2}d\theta
\]</span></p><p>Such inversions, then, constitute what we may call the standard
difficulty of the problem, and I shall base my system of marking
primarily upon them. <em>For every such inversion involved in the
proof I shall assign <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> marks</em>. Besides these marks I shall
add, in a more capricious way, marks for artificiality, complexity,
etc. The proof obtaining least marks is to be regarded as the simples
and best.</p><ol><li id="proof1"><div class="body"><p><em>Mr. Berry’s first proof</em>.<a class="noteMark" id="noteMark-iMeanOf" href="#noteText-iMeanOf">4</a> This is that
expressed by the series of equations
<span class="math display">\[
   \begin{alignedat}{2}
   \int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}x ddx
       &amp;= \int_0^\infty \lim_{a\to 0} \bigl(e^{-ax} \frac{\sin x}x\bigr) dx
        = \lim_{a\to 0}\int_0^\infty e^{-ax} \frac{\sin x}x dx \\
       &amp;= \lim_{a\to 0}\int_0^\infty e^{-ax}dx\int_0^1\cos tx dt
        = \lim_{a\to 0}\int_0^1 dt \int_0^\infty e^{-ax}\cos txdx \\
       &amp;= \lim_{a\to 0}\int_0^1 \frac{a dt}{a^2 + t^2}
        = \lim_{a\to 0} \arctan{\frac 1a}
        = \frac 12 \pi.
   \end{alignedat}
 \]</span>


This is a difficult proof, theoretically, Each of the first two
lines involves, on the face of it, an inversion of limits. In
reality each involves more: for integration, with an infinite
limit, is in itself an operation of <em>repeated</em> procedure to a
limit; and we ought really to write
<span class="math display">\[
   \int_0^\infty \lim_{a\to 0}
     = \lim_{X\to\infty}\int_0^X\lim_{a\to 0}
     = \lim_{X\to\infty}\lim_{a\to 0}\int_0^X
     = \lim_{a\to 0}\lim_{X\to\infty}\int_0^X
     = \lim_{a\to 0}\int_0^\infty .
 \]</span></p><p>Thus <em>two</em> inversions are involved in the first line; and so
also in the second. This involves 40 marks. One the other hand
this proof is, apart from theoretical difficulties, simple and
natural: I do not think it is necessary to add more marks. Thus
our total is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{40}\)</span>.</p></div></li><li id="proof2"><div class="body"><p><em>Mr. Berry’s second proof</em>. This is expressed by the equations
<span class="math display">\[
   \begin{alignedat}{2}
   \int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}x dx
     &amp;= \frac 12 \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\sin x}x dx
      = \frac 12 \sum_{i=-\infty}^\infty \int_{i\pi}^{(i+1)\pi} \frac{\sin x}x dx \\
     &amp;= \frac 12 \sum_{-\infty}^\infty (-1)^i \int_0^\pi \frac{\sin x}{x - i\pi} dx
      = \frac 12 \int_0^\pi \sin x \sum_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{(-1)^i}{x + i\pi} dx \\
     &amp;= \frac 12 \int_0^\pi \sin x\, \cosec x \,dx
      = \frac 12 \pi.
   \end{alignedat}
 \]</span></p><p>It is obvious that this has a great advantage over the first proof
in that only one inversion is involved. On the other hand the
uniform convergence of the series to be integrated is, as Mr. Berry
remarks, <q>not quite obvious.</q> Moreover the fact that the cosecant
series contains the terms
<span class="math display">\[
   \frac 1x - \frac 1{x - \pi},
 \]</span>
which become infinite at the limits, although it does not really add
to the difficulty of the proof, does involve a light amount of
additional care in its statement. I am inclined to assign 15 marks,
therefore, instead of 10 only, for this inversion. For the first
three steps in the proof I assign 3 marks each; for the use of the
cosecant series 4. Thus the total mark may be estimated at
<span class="math inline">\(9+15+4=\mathbf{28}\)</span>.</p></div></li><li id="proof3"><div class="body"><p><em>Mr. Berry’s third proof (by contour integration)</em>. It is
naturally a little harder to estimate the difficulties of a proof
which depends upon the theory of analytic functions. It seems to me
not unreasonable to assign 10 marks for the use of Cauchy’s theorem
in its simplest form, when we remember that the proof of the
theorem which depends upon the formula<a class="noteMark" id="noteMark-forsyth" href="#noteText-forsyth">5</a>
<span class="math display">\[
   \int\int\Bigl(\frac{\partial q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial p}{\partial y}\Bigr)
     = \int(p dx + q dy)
 \]</span>
involves the reduction of a double integral partly by integration
with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and partly by integration with respect to
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. The actual theoretical difficulty of this proof of
Cauchy’s theorem I should be disposed to estimate at about 20; but
half that amount seems sufficient for the mere use of a well known
standard theorem<a class="noteMark" id="noteMark-goursatsProof" href="#noteText-goursatsProof">6</a>.</p><p>The particular problem of contour integration with which we are
concerned is, however, by no means a really simple one. The range of
integration is infinite, the pole occurs <em>on</em> the contour; we
have to use the fact that
<span class="math display">\[
   \lim_{R=\infty}\lim_{\varepsilon=0}\Bigl(\int_{-R}^{-\varepsilon} + \int_\varepsilon^R\Bigr)
                                      \frac{e^{ix}}x dx
     = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\sin x}x dx.
 \]</span></p><p>For this I assign 8 marks; for the valuation of the limit of the
integral round the <q>small semicircle</q> another 8. There remains the
proof that the integral round the <q>large semicircle</q> tends to
zero. As Mr. Berry points out, the ordinary proof is really rather
difficult; I estimate its difficulty at 16. Mr. Berry has suggested a
simplification of this part of the argument; the difficulty of his
proof I estimate at 8. Thus we have <span class="math inline">\(10+8+8+16=\mathbf{42}\)</span>
marks for the ordinary proof, and <span class="math inline">\(10+8+8+8=\mathbf{34}\)</span> for
Mr. Berry’s modification of it.</p></div></li><li id="proof4"><div class="body"><p><em>Prof. Nanson’s proof</em>. This proof, I must confess, does not
appeal to me. Starting from the integral
<span class="math display">\[
   u = \int_0^\infty \frac{a\cos cx}{a^2 + x^2} dx,
 \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> are positive, we show, by a repeated
integration by parts, and a repeated differentiation under the
integral sign, that <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> satisfies the equation
<span class="math display">\[
   \frac{d^2 u}{da^2} = c^2u.
 \]</span></p><p>As the upper limit is infinite we ought to assign 40 marks for
this, following the principles we adopted in marking the first
proof; but as the two operations of differentiation involve
inversions of the same character I reduce this to 30, adding 6,
however, for the repeated integration by parts.</p><p>The transformation <span class="math inline">\(x=ay\)</span> shows that <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is a
function of <span class="math inline">\(ac\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(u=Ae^{ac} + Be^{-ac}\)</span>,
where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are independent of both <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. This step in the proof I assess at 4.</p><p>That <span class="math inline">\(A=0\)</span> is proved by making <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> tend to
<span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> and observing that
<span class="math display">\[
   \lvert u\rvert &lt; \int_0^\infty \frac{adx}{a^2+x^2} = \frac 12\pi.
 \]</span>
For this I assign 6 marks.</p><p>That <span class="math inline">\(c = \frac 12\pi\)</span> is proved by making <span class="math inline">\(c=0\)</span>. Here
we assume the continuity of the integral, and this should
involve 20 marks. But as the proof is simple I reduce this to
12. Thus by the time that we have proved that
<span class="math display">\[
   u = \frac 12\pi c^{-ca},
 \]</span>
we have incurred <span class="math inline">\(30+6+4+6+12=58\)</span> marks.</p><p>We have then
<span class="math display">\[
   \begin{alignedat}{2}
     \int_0^\infty \frac{a\sin mxdx}{x(a^2+x^2)}
     &amp;= \int_0^\infty \frac{adx}{a^2 + x^2}
        \int_0^m \cos cxdc \\
     &amp;= \int_0^m udc
      = \frac \pi{2a}(1 - e^{-am}).
   \end{alignedat}
 \]</span></p><p>This involves 20 marks. We then obtain
<span class="math display">\[
   \int_0^\infty \frac{x\sin mx}{a^2+x^2} dx = \frac 12\pi e^{-am}
 \]</span>
by two differentiations with respect to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. This should
strictly involve 40, and I cannot reduce the number to less than
30, as the second differentiation is none too easy to
justify. The result then follows by multiplying the last formula
but one by <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and adding it to the second.</p><p>I do not think that <span class="math inline">\(58+20+30=\mathbf{108}\)</span> marks which we
have assigned are more than the difficulties of the proof we
deserve. But of course it is hardly fair to contrast this heavy
mark with the 40, 28, 42, 36 which we have obtained for the
others; for Prof. Nanson has evaluated the integrals
<span class="math display">\[
   \int_0^\infty \frac{\sin mx}{x(a^2+x^2)}dx,\:
   \int_0^\infty \frac{\cos mx}{a^2+x^2}dx,\:
   \int_0^\infty \frac{x\sin mx}{a^2+x^2}dx,\:

as well as the integral (<a class="ref" href="#mjx-eqn-subject"><span class="number">1</span></a>).</p></div></li><li id="proof5"><div class="body"><p><em>Mr. Michell’s proof</em>.<a class="noteMark" id="noteMark-thisProofIs" href="#noteText-thisProofIs">7</a> This depends on

slightly more simple in details and arrangement, viz.:

 \]</span></p><p>The successive steps of the proof can of course be stated in a
form free from <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> by merely taking the real part of the

at the end of Prof. Nanson’s paper. Hence

that Mr. Berry’s second proof is distinctly the best. But whether this
be so or not, one thing at any rate should be clear from this
discussion: whatever method be chosen, the evaluation of the integral

the legitimate range of school mathematics.</p></div><div class="sectionContent"></div></section></section></section><section class="notes"><ol><li id="noteText-berryNanson"><a href="#noteMark-berryNanson" class="noteMarkBack">↑︎</a><span class="body"><span class="cite"><span class="personalName">A.
