Metadata:

- original authorship and such (perhaps collected from the sources?)

- sources of the work (for digitized things). Possibly designating one
  or more sources as primary?

- editors of the digitization?

We should just collect all the sources together and display them as a
single citation, perhaps, in a summary. (So author: Riemann, editor:
whoever1, whoever2, where whoever1 and 2 are potentially from
different editions)
